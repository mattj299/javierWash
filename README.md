## Built using React

I built this project using create-react-app

## Project use

This is Javier Car Wash Company which he can be called to wash cars whenever needed only in certain areas.
The api leaflet.js was used to create the map and the red circle in the map to show the locations that he can drive to

## Why this was built

This project was built when I was learning react and it's to test out what I learned from react as well as build a little website for a
potential client in the future.
